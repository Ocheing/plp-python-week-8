## 🚀 How to Run the Notebook

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open the `.ipynb` notebook in **Jupyter** or **VS Code** with the Jupyter extension.
3. Run each cell from top to bottom.
4. Ensure you have the required libraries installed:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn

📊 Key Insights
🇮🇳 India saw a rapid increase in vaccinations post-2021.

🇺🇸 USA maintained high total case counts, reflecting extensive testing and population size.

🇰🇪 Kenya had a slower vaccination rollout but consistent progress.

Death rates declined as vaccinations increased across all three countries.

## ✅ **How to Export Jupyter Notebook as PDF in VS Code**

### Option 1: Using the Built-in Export (Best Option)

1. Open your `.ipynb` notebook in VS Code.
2. In the top right corner of the notebook, click the **"Export"** button (looks like a square with an arrow).
3. Choose `PDF`.
4. Wait for it to convert and save — you'll be prompted to download/save the PDF.

> 🔧 If it asks for a LaTeX installation (like `TeX Live`), and you don't have it, use Option 2 below.
